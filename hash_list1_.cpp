We cannot initialise values inside the class because 
1. variable will have value for which memory is needed which cant happen until
 objects initialised 
2.  you will have a value even though you don't have any object but what does it represents?
That's why constructors are there to help us so that we can initialze the instances
 whenever it is legitimate to do so...
If the kind of initialization you are thinking of start happening what would you achieve 
with that it will be completed useless...

Hence, when you define a class you donâ€™t actually allocate memory so there is no scope of 
initializing a variable instead memory is allocated when you declare an object of that 
class and that is when you should initialize your variable of the class. Each object 
could have either same or different values of the variables.

// to remove ambiguity for each object as functions are stored as single copy

We needed another table as 1 is for declaring the hash table of size S which stores the 
index and then their indexes or keys would be computed for the hash function in functions
of class hash1. Making a class was necessary as constructors and more organized look.

    This a double pointer pointing to the array of hashtable pointers
    - dynamic array of size S of pointers to hashtable class

    It is a way of creating pointer array to hashtable which would contain keys or indices
    which would point to the linked list


    Now, putting null on all values of t[] as they would be memory leaks instead.

Size preferably prime and not a power of 2 or near to it as it shows similar pattern of
same allocation of bits on same key with last k bits for table of size 2^k.
if k=4 then last 4 bits only considered and rest all with same last 4 bits are
put under the same key which is a huge problem especially something like phone numbers.
So, preferably size of table m or S should be prime and not near power of 2.
